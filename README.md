I am using OpenAI Gym to test all algorithms [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) 

Next Steps: Artificial Intelligence Peter Norvig and Stuart Russel

All of the code is my own, written using my personal equipment during lunch breaks, vacation days 
and when I'm waiting for someone. It is not representative of my employer or any work related to my employment.

If you don't like my code or think I suck at this. I agree with you and I'll keep refactoring.
